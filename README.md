This is still being tidied up from production code and needs to be altered for reusability

TODO

- Rename the method names and tidy up the codebase.
- Document the comments and add docs.
- Change the firebase connection to a better configuration feature
- Add tests for the script
- Add more features that are suitable for only firebase firestore
